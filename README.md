# Getting Started with Flask React App
For the backend (Flask), it's necessary to activate a virtual environment first. After completing this step, run:
### `(venv)  export FLASK_APP=app.py`
### `(venv)  flask run`

If it's necessary, install any missing dependency by running the following command inside the api folder:
### `pip install <name of package>`

For the frontend (React):
### `npm start`

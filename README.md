# Getting Started with Flask React App

There are two branches: **main** and **master**.  The second one contains the frontend subfolder which is not available in the main branch.
For the backend (Flask), it's necessary to activate a virtual environment first. After completing this step, run this command under the root folder:
### `(venv)  export FLASK_APP=app.py`
### `(venv)  flask run`

If it's necessary, install any missing dependency by running the following command inside the api folder:
### `pip3 install <name of package> (Mac)`

For the frontend (React):
### `npm start`
